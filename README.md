# Vector-Visualization

This repository contains files for the vector visualization project. I began this project after beginning my Linear Algebra for Engineers course. I wanted to pratice my programming skills along with gaining a greater understanding of vectors in linear algebra. The aim is to use the numpy and matplotlib libraries to visualize a vector field that vectors can be added to. In doing so, it will provide greater understanding of how the vectors are placed in a uniform field.
